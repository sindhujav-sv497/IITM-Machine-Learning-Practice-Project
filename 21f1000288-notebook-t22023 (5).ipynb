The distributor also won't affect how someone finds the movie because say, even if well reputed distributor, if the movie was bad the reviewer will give negative review only.\n\n**For Second trial use (using feature selection):**\nSome features like rating, ratingContents, boxOffice, and soundType would have to be dropped because they have more than 50% null values.
